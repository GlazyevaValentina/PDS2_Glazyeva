Paradise Apple Jelly

Ingredients:

3.5 Kg apples (weight for other ingredients)

3.5 Kg of confiture sugar (same weight as apples)

Method

Wash and trim the apples. Fortunately there is no need to peel or core these. 
Place in a large pan with the sugar and bring slowly to the boil. 
Stew for 20 minutes until soft. Strain through a jelly-bag removing any scum. 
Bring to the boil and boil until a little sets when tested. Store in glass jars in a cool larder. 
Apple jelly testes great.
